This repository contains materials related to a Bank Churn Analysis project, where we analyze and predict customer churn for a bank using data analytics and machine learning models. The project aims to identify factors contributing to churn and predict which customers are most likely to churn.
>> 1- Churn_Modelling.csv:
This dataset contains information about customers, such as demographics, bank details, and churn status.
Features include customer age, balance, number of products, and whether they have exited (churned) or not.
you can upload from :-   https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhbadole/bank-customer-churn-prediction-dataset

>> 2- Churn Prediction Model.ipynb:
This Jupyter Notebook contains the Python code used for building and training the churn prediction model.
The model is built using machine learning algorithms like Random Forest and XGBoost to predict customer churn.
It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation metrics such as accuracy and F1 score.

>> 3- Cleaned Bank Churn Analysis.pbix:
This is the Power BI report file, providing visual insights from the churn dataset.
It includes dashboards to visualize churn rates, customer segmentation, and other key performance indicators (KPIs).

             
                   >> How to Use <<
                   
> Churn_Modelling.csv:
Download the dataset and explore the customer information and churn labels.
You can use it for data exploration, model training, and testing.

> Churn Prediction Model.ipynb:
Open the Jupyter Notebook file in any Python environment (such as JupyterLab or Google Colab).
Make sure to install the necessary Python libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and xgboost.
Run the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

> Cleaned Bank Churn Analysis.pbix:
Open the .pbix file using Power BI Desktop.
Explore the visualizations and insights, such as churn analysis by demographics, products, and geography.

                 >>Results & Insights<<
The machine learning model achieved high accuracy in predicting customer churn.
The Power BI report provides an intuitive way to explore churn trends and customer segments.
The analysis reveals that customer tenure, number of products, and balance significantly affect churn rates.

                  >>Tools Used<<
Python: For data analysis and building machine learning models.
Power BI: For interactive data visualization.
Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost: For data processing and machine learning.
